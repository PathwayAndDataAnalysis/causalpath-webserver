    "Description" : "This parameter determines how to use the values in the proteomics file. Options are listed below. When there is only one value column and no transformation is desired, users can select any of the first 3 options, as they have no effect on a single value.\n\tarithmetic-mean: The arithmetic mean value of the given values is used for significance detection of a single change. There should only be one group of values (marked with value-column), the values have to be distributed around zero, and a threshold value should be provided for significance detection, using the threshold-for-data-significance.\n\tgeometric-mean: The geometric mean value of the given values is used for significance detection of a single change. This is the only case when the geometric mean is used for averaging a group of samples, and it is appropriate if the individual values are formed of some kind of ratios. There should only be one group of values (marked with value-column), the values have to be distributed around zero, and a threshold value should be provided for significance detection, using the threshold-for-data-significance.\n\tmax: The value with maximum absolute is used for the analysis. There should only be one group of values (marked with value-column), the values have to be distributed around zero, and a threshold value should be provided for significance detection, using the threshold-for-data-significance.\n\tdifference-of-means: There should be control and test values, whose difference would be used for significance detection. The threshold for significance (threshold-for-data-significance) should also be provided.\n\tfold-change-of-mean: There should be control and test values, whose ratio will be converted to fold change and thresholded. The fold change value will be in the range (-inf, -1] + [1, inf). If the data file already contains a fold-change value, then please use the geometric-mean as value transformation. The threshold for significance (threshold-for-data-significance) should also be provided.\n\tsignificant-change-of-mean: There should be sufficient amount of control and test values to detect the significance of change with a t-test. Technically there should be more than 3 controls and 3 tests, practically, they should be much more to provide statistical power. The threshold-for-data-significance should be used for a p-value threshold, or alternatively, fdr-threshold-for-data-significance should be used for controlling significance at the false discovery rate level.\n\tsignificant-change-of-mean-paired: There should be sufficient amount of control and test values to detect the significance of change with a paired t-test. Technically there should be at least 3 controls and 3 tests, practically, they should be much more to provide statistical power. The order of control and test value columns indicate the pairing. First control column in the parameters file is paired with first test column, second is paired with second, etc. The threshold-for-data-significance should be used for a p-value threshold, or alternatively, fdr-threshold-for-data-significance should be used for controlling significance at the false discovery rate level.\n\tsigned-p-values: If the dataset has its own calculation of p-values desired to be used directly, then for each comparison, there must be a column in the dataset that has these p-values multiplied with the sign of the change. For instance a value -0.001 means downregulation with a p-value of 0.001. Don't use 0 and -0 values in the data file with this option. Java cannot distinguish between the two. Instead, convert 0 values to very small but nonzero values, such as 1e-10 or -1e-10. If an FDR control is desired, there are two ways to have it. First way is to use unadjusted p-values in the data file and then use the fdr-threshold-for-data-significance parameter to set the desired FDR level. Second way is to use adjusted p-values in the data file and use the threshold-for-data-significance parameter to set the FDR level. Don't mix these two ways. If fdr-threshold-for-data-significance is used over already-adjusted p-values, then the code will apply the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure over those already-adjusted p-values.\n\tcorrelation: There should be one group of values (marked with value-column). There must be at least 3 value columns technically, but many more than that practically to have some statistical power for significant correlation. \n",
